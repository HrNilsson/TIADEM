 This command should be called by the receiver of a message. The time
 of the synchronization event is returned as expressed in the local
 clock of the caller. This command MUST BE called only on the receiver
 side and only for messages transmitted via the TimeSyncSend interface.
 It is recommended that this command be called from the receive event
 handler.

 Returns TRUE if the value returned by <tt>getTime</tt> can be trusted.
 Under certain circumstances the received message cannot be properly
 time stamped, so the sender-receiver synchronization cannot be finished
 on the receiver side. In this case, this command returns FALSE.
 This command MUST BE called only on the receiver side and only for
 messages transmitted via the TimeSyncSend interface. It is recommended
 that this command be called from the receive event handler.
