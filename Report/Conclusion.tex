\section{Conclusion} % (fold)
\label{sec:conclusion}
	In this project an implementation of the DFTSP on TelosB motes have been developed. 
	The implementation have been tested on a small scale test setup with two motes in a temperature stable and unstable environment. 
	The test results shows the correlation between synchronization error, beacon period, temperature and skew.
	From the results, it is clear to see that motes exposed to unstable environments need lower synchronization interval to maintain the same synchronization accuracy.

	By using the DFTSP instead of the FTSP a variable synchronization period is introduced, which reduces the overall transmission overhead, since the period can be reduced, when the environment is stable and increased when unstable.
	In a WSN network this will mean lower power consumption in all motes.
